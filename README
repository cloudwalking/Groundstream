Layout note: I tried using Masonry to make the posts stack better. Because there are so many pictures and they load slowly, it really screws up the whole page. Images overlap each other because they aren't loaded when the masonry layout fires, and if you repeatedly fire the layout method it makes the scroll position jump terribly.
